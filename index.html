            usually expressed through short articles, usually accompanied by photographs. Depending on the specific company, some information about goals, attitude or other aspects of culture that aren't strictly tied to business practices are included
            as well. The about us page is often a reflection of the purpose and personality of the business and its owners or top employees. Finally, the page can also incorporate contact or locational information. One way to view the about us concept
            is as a text self-portrait or short autobiography created by a business.
